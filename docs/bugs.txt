- There is a bug when message is not captured when there is already entry in addressing config file , which has the same address but different
class type . For example it was reported error event first but then it was reported real value .

- problem with extracting values from exclusion report  "ui_element": {
  "ui_element": "free_text",
  "value_path": "$.event.value"
 },

- global.json update during upgrade.

- on SG installation may fail because of setuptools error . If it happens then delete the files :
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources.pyc

rm /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources.p*
